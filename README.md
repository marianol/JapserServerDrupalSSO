=====================

Drupal Module to integrate Jasper Report Server (SSO)

This is just a POC on how can you do a simple SSO with Drupal and Jasper when they are in the same TLD.

The current module works but requires that users be syncronized manually.

@todo
- Add hooks on Drupal create and modify user to do the same in JasperServer using the REST API
